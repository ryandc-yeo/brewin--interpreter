# Building an interpreter for the Brewin# programming language

Hi there! This is a repo for [CS 131 - Spring 2023](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/spring-23/)'s course-long project: making an interpreter.

### Setup
This project uses features of Python 3.11. So, **you must be running Python 3.11 locally**.
Next, clone this repository and make it your working directory:

Here's a working version of the interpreter: [online interpreter](https://barista.fly.dev/).

### Features

- Constants
- Expressions
- Classes
  - Fields, Methods
- Objects

  - begin, call, if, input, print, return, set, while
- Static Typing
- Default field, local variable, and return values
- Inheritance
- Polymorhpism
- Class Templates
- Exception Handling
